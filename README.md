2016 06. PROJECT CLOSED
This is a try to fix up the original SS Siteboost for Shutterstock application script.
Use it with the Greasemonkey add-on for Firefox.
FF, Chrome and other extensions, as they were available with 0.29b are not ready yet.

Some features don't work. Main Live Stats panel should work, also Referrals and Total Stats. 
Because it's an early phase of the revival process, you should be aware that some figures in stats may not be correct, 
ALTHOUGH I haven't noticed such behavior.

**** DISCLAIMER ****
EARLY TEST VERSION!
Provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. 
Use at your own risk.
Feedback much appreciated.
